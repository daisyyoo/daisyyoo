## :speech_balloon: About Me
:cookie: I'm an avid food lover, ex-sous chef, software developer with a passion to make things nice.

:book: I love learning new skills despite the constant struggle of wondering why my computer is broken 

😄 When I'm not coding, you can find me cooking, baking and/or looking up the next recipes to cook/bake.

⚡ Fun fact: I built an e-commerce website for my cookie business to learn coding. [Check it out here](https://delights-by-daisy.delightsbydaisy.de/)
