### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Daisy Yoo

:cookie: I'm an avid food lover, ex-sous chef, software developer with a passion to make things nice.

I love learning new skills despite the constant struggle of wondering why my computer is broken :joy: When I'm not coding, you can find me cooking, baking and/or looking up the next recipes to cook/bake.

- ðŸ”­ I'm current working on react hooks and react native
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning typescript
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [@daisyyoo25](https://www.instagram.com/daisyyoo25/)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I built an e-commerce website for my cookie business to learn coding. [Check it out here](https://delights-by-daisy.delightsbydaisy.de/)
